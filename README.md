# TaxiSimulation

A simulation of a ride-sharing service to see the effect of different scenarios

Drivers gives rides to riders, the dispatcher handles requests from drivers and riders, 
and the monitor keeps track of the whole simulation. 

Accepts various inputs of drivers and riders at different locations with different patience levels. 

After the simulation is run, statistics are returned which can be used to evaluate how the set up performs.
